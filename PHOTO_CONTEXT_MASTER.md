## 📋 HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. **Find any photo** - All photos are listed by category below
2. **See the context** - Context is shown after each filename
3. **Add missing context** - Empty spaces mean context is needed from you
4. **Reference usage** - See PHOTO_USAGE_TRACKER.md to see where photos are used

## 🎯 IMAGE POSITION SYSTEM

Since cards are horizontal (16:9) but some photos are vertical, you can control which part of the image is shown when cropped.

### Position Scale (1-10):
```
10 = TOP    (show the top of the photo - faces at top)
 9 = 
 8 = 
 7 = 
 6 = 
 5 = MIDDLE (default - center of photo)
 4 = 
 3 = 
 2 = 
 1 = BOTTOM (show the bottom of the photo - feet visible)
```

### How to Specify Position:
Add `{pos:X}` after the context, where X is 1-10.

**Examples:**
```
- `basketball-headshot1.JPG` - my modeling career is dead and gone {pos:9}
  → Shows mostly the top of the image (good for headshots)

- `fav-basketball-photo.jpg` - WHITE MAN CAN JUMP {pos:3}
  → Shows mostly the bottom (captures the jump action)

- `vintage-paris.JPG` - Vintage lense of Paris {pos:5}
  → Shows the middle (default, no need to specify)
```

### Quick Reference:
- **Headshots/Faces at top** → `{pos:8}` to `{pos:10}`
- **Centered subjects** → `{pos:5}` (or don't specify)
- **Action at bottom/Feet** → `{pos:1}` to `{pos:3}`
- **Landscapes/Wide shots** → Usually `{pos:5}` is fine
