## 🎯 THE NEW SYSTEM - 3 Source of Truth Files

I've consolidated all your photo documentation into **THREE master files**. Everything you need is here:

### 1️⃣ **PHOTO_CONTEXT_MASTER.md** 
**What it is:** Complete inventory of ALL 280+ photos with their contexts  
**Use it for:** 
- Finding any photo by name
- Seeing what context exists for each photo
- Adding context to photos without descriptions
- Reference for all available photos

### 2️⃣ **PHOTO_USAGE_TRACKER.md**
**What it is:** Tracking system showing where each photo is used (or not used)  
**Use it for:**
- Seeing which photos are on which pages
- Finding unused photos with context ready to add
- Understanding usage statistics by page
- Planning which photos to add next

### 3️⃣ **TODO_FOR_GAVIN.md**
**What it is:** Your prioritized action list of what content/context is needed  
**Use it for:**
- Knowing exactly what to work on next
- Seeing time estimates for each task
- Understanding impact of different tasks
- Tracking your progress

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Writing Photo Context:
- **Be specific:** Include names, places, dates when relevant
- **Be personal:** Write like you're telling a friend
- **Be fun:** Your tone is casual and humorous - embrace it!
- **Be brief:** 1-2 sentences is perfect (more is bonus)

### Good Context Examples:
✅ "I'm lowkey kinda strong this boy is like 110kg"  
✅ "Best Friends for more than half of our lives. Here's to the rest of it"  
✅ "Me and my cousins receiving our Christmas presents on our nana's floor, 2010"

### Not-So-Good Context Examples:
❌ "Basketball photo" (too vague)  
❌ "Me with friends" (not specific)  
❌ "2023" (no story)

### Taking Screenshots:
- **Resolution:** 1200x600px is ideal (but any clear screenshot works)
- **Clean up:** Close extra tabs, hide personal info
- **Capture:** Show the key features and interfaces
- **Crop:** Focus on the important parts

### Creating Blog Images:
- **Use Canva:** Easiest option with templates
- **Be consistent:** Same style across all 9 images
- **Use your photos:** Can use existing photos as backgrounds
- **Add text:** Make titles readable at small sizes

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't know what context to add"

→ Open TODO_FOR_GAVIN.md and start with 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY items. They're quick wins with big impact.

### "I found a photo that's not listed"
→ Add it to PHOTO_CONTEXT_MASTER.md in the appropriate section with its context.

### "I want to remove a photo from the website"
→ Check PHOTO_USAGE_TRACKER.md to see where it's used, then update the page code to remove it.

### "A photo is in the wrong section"
→ No worries! Just let me know and I'll move it to the right place.
