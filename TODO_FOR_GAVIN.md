```
- `filename.jpg` - [1-2 sentence description. Keep it fun and personal. Explain what's happening, where, and why it matters.]
```

### Good Examples:
- ✅ "I'm lowkey kinda strong this boy is like 110kg" (fun, personal, specific)
- ✅ "The highest of fives for my friend Mark (I blocked him fr)" (humor, context, detail)
- ✅ "Me and my cousins receiving our Christmas presents on our nana's floor, 2010" (clear, specific, meaningful)

### Not-So-Good Examples:
- ❌ "Basketball photo" (too vague)
- ❌ "Me with friends" (not specific enough)
- ❌ "Photo from 2023" (no story or meaning)
