# 🚀 Quick Start: Adding Photo Context

## 📝 How to Add Context

### Step 1: Open a Markdown File
Choose one of these files to start:
- `curious/PHOTO_CONTEXT.md`
- `fans/PHOTO_CONTEXT.md`
- `suitors/PHOTO_CONTEXT.md`
- `employers/PHOTO_CONTEXT.md`
- `investors/PHOTO_CONTEXT.md`
- `engineers/PHOTO_CONTEXT.md`

### Step 2: Find the "⚠️ PHOTOS THAT NEED CONTEXT" Section
This is at the **TOP** of each file.

### Step 3: Add Your Context
Just type after the dash (`-`):

**Example:**
```markdown
- `basketball-photoshoot-main.JPG` - This was my favorite shot from our team photoshoot in 2023. We had just won the Leinster championship and wanted to capture the moment.
```

### Step 4: Save and Let Me Know
Once you've added context to any photos, just tell me and I'll:
1. Create Netflix-style cards for them
2. Add them to the appropriate pages
3. Implement any special features (like the carousel)

## 💡 Context Examples

### Brief (One Line):
```markdown
- `photo.jpg` - Me and my best friend Luke at our first baseball game in Boston, 2019
```

### Detailed (Full Story):
```markdown
- `photo.jpg` - **The Day Everything Changed:** This was taken the Tuesday after I decided to leave teaching. I was nervous but excited, sitting in my favorite coffee shop (3fe) with my friend who encouraged me to take the leap. The barista, Eric (we call him the Wizard), made me this perfect latte and said "here's to new beginnings." That coffee somehow tasted like courage.
```

### Multiple Related Photos:
```markdown
- `paris1.jpg` - Vintage Paris trip, 2020 - walking along the Seine
- `paris2.jpg` - Same trip - found this amazing little cafe in Montmartre
- `paris3.jpg` - Same trip - sunset from Sacré-Cœur
```

## ❌ What to Skip

If you don't want to use a photo, just **leave it blank**:
```markdown
- `photo-i-dont-want.jpg` - 
```

Or delete the line entirely!

---

## ✅ Current Status

- **77 photos** already have context and are live on the site
- **167 photos** are waiting for context
- **Engineers page** is 86% complete (only 2 photos need context!) ✅
- **Investors page** is 73% complete (only 3 photos need context!) ✅

---

## 🔄 The Process

1. You add context → I get notified
2. I create beautiful Netflix cards with your descriptions
3. Cards go live on the appropriate persona page
4. Repeat for as many photos as you want!

**No pressure!** Add context at your own pace. Even adding context to 10-20 high-impact photos will dramatically improve the site.

## 💬 Questions?

Just ask! For example:
- "Can you show me what photos are in the Paris series?"
- "What basketball photos are already used?"
- "Which page needs the most attention?"

Ready when you are! 🎬
